# 2D-histogram-filter
The Purpose of the project is to implement a 2-dimensional histogram filter for a robot living on a colored cyclical grid.

## Prerequisites/Dependencies
* Visual Studio Code, You can download it by clicking [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
* To setup python in VS Code, follow instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).
* Additionally, you can also work on [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb).

## Instructions
